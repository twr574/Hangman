HANGMAN!
---------

- A one-player game where you have to guess a randomly chosen word.
            
- Each turn, either guess a letter in the word, or the word itself (upper or lower case).
              
- If you succeed (by guessing the word, or all the letters in the word), your score increases.
              
	- The score you get for each round is dependent on the difficulty and number of incorrect guesses remaining.   
              
- If you fail to guess the word, you lose a life. 

	- You can sometimes gain extra lives by accumulating spare guesses over many rounds.

- Spellings use British English.
	
	- No punctuations (e.g. hyphens, apostrophes) or abbreviations are allowed.

	- Some loan-words, archaic words and technical terms may be found on harder difficulties.

	- Ignore diacritical marks (e.g. in 'naive'). The 'ae' ligature is spelled with two letters.
